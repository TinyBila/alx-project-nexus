Server-side rendering (SSR) & static site generation (SSG)
Client vs server components
Middleware and API routes

## Tailwind CSS
Utility-first styling
Responsive design best practices
Component reusability and layout consistency

## TypeScript
Strong typing
Interfaces, types, generics
Error prevention and improved code reliability

## System Design & Analysis
Understanding user requirements
Breaking down features into components
Architectural decision-making
Scalability and performance considerations

## API Integration
Fetching data using fetch/Axios

# Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented
1. Complex API integrations

Challenge: Handling inconsistent or slow API responses.
Solution:

Implemented loading skeletons

Added error boundaries

Used caching and retries

Utilized tools like React Query for optimization

2. Styling Responsively Across Devices

Challenge: Making sure layouts work across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Solution:

Leveraged Tailwind responsive utilities

Used flex and grid systems

Performed mobile-first testing

3. Managing State Across Components

Challenge: Passing multiple states between deeply nested components.
Solution:

Used Context API

Lifted state where appropriate

Implemented reusable hooks

Used Zustand or Redux where needed

4. TypeScript Errors & Type Mismatches

Challenge: Strict typing causing frequent errors.
Solution:

Created reusable types/interfaces

Applied type narrowing and generics

Improved understanding of unions and optional types

# Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
## Best Practices

Write clean, readable, and maintainable code

Use meaningful commit messages

Follow mobile-first, responsive design principles

Create reusable components

Regularly refactor and review code

Document features and APIs clearly

Maintain folder structure consistency

## Personal Takeaways

Consistency matters more than speed

Debugging is part of the learning process

TypeScript improves confidence and code quality

Designing before coding saves time later

Collaboration and communication elevate the project

Breaking problems into smaller tasks makes them manageable

## Conclusion

The ProDev Frontend Engineering Program has strengthened my skills in both web and mobile development, improved my understanding of modern frameworks, and prepared me to build scalable, user-friendly applications.
